## Unreleased

## 2.0.0-rc.3 (August 19, 2026)

BUG FIXES:

* **Terraform Registry documentation layout:** Keep YAML frontmatter at the first line of generated WAF resource documentation and move the generated-file marker below it, allowing the Registry to parse page metadata and preserve the WAF subcategory.

## 2.0.0-rc.2 (August 19, 2026)

NOTES:

* **Major WAF provider expansion:** Version 2.0 grows the provider from two resources to 69 resources and two data sources. It adds typed Terraform management for application configuration, WAF modules, templates, template modules, origin servers, template attachments, and supporting read-only views.
* **Supported scope:** `certificate_mode` switches an application between automatic and custom certificate management, but this release does not upload certificate, private-key, CA, or CRL content. The `log_settings` API is also not exposed because it does not provide a durable typed configuration contract.

BUG FIXES:

* **Readable API validation errors:** Preserve sanitized `detail` and `message` reasons in provider diagnostics while continuing to redact credentials, request values, endpoint identifiers, and secret-bearing response fields.

BREAKING CHANGES:

* **Configuration migration is required:** Existing v1.0.5 state for `fortiappseccloud_waf_app` and `fortiappseccloud_waf_openapi_validation` is upgraded automatically, but configurations must be updated to the v2 schema before the first normal plan. Follow the [v1.0.5 to v2.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/sqaz91819/terraform-provider-fas-dev/blob/v2.0.0-rc.2/website/docs/guides/v1_0_5_to_v2_0_0.html.markdown), begin with a refresh-only plan, and do not apply an unexpected delete or replacement plan.
* **Application schema and identity:** `fortiappseccloud_waf_app` now uses stable application endpoint IDs and replaces legacy arguments such as `app_service`, `origin_server_*`, `block`, and computed `cname` with typed `services`, `initial_origin`, `block_mode`, and `cnames` fields. Platform and placement must be represented explicitly where required.
* **OpenAPI validation identity:** `fortiappseccloud_waf_openapi_validation` now identifies its application with `ep_id` instead of `app_name`. Keep the existing Terraform resource address and validation-file paths during migration.

FEATURES:

* **Application-level WAF modules:** Added 33 typed `fortiappseccloud_waf_<module>` resources covering security rules, access controls, API protection, bot mitigation, request and response controls, DDoS protection, waiting rooms, caching and compression, request rewriting, content routing, and other WAF configuration modules.
* **WAF templates and template modules:** Added `fortiappseccloud_waf_template` for create, read, import, and delete lifecycle management by stable `template_id`; `fortiappseccloud_waf_template_attachment` for application membership; and 31 typed `fortiappseccloud_waf_template_<module>` resources that use the same typed configuration models as their application-level counterparts.
* **Application and origin management:** Reworked `fortiappseccloud_waf_app` to manage application identity, placement, listeners, CDN and block modes, bootstrap origin, and observed certificate mode. Added `fortiappseccloud_waf_origin_servers` for ongoing ownership of complete origin-server pools.
* **WAF data sources:** Added `fortiappseccloud_waf_modules` for application module status and `fortiappseccloud_waf_signature_exception` for read-only signature-exception details.
* **Certificate management mode:** Added `certificate_mode` to `fortiappseccloud_waf_app` for switching between `automatic` and `custom` certificate management without placing certificate or private-key content in Terraform configuration.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* **Preserving WAF module updates:** Module updates use fresh remote reads and merge typed Terraform changes into the complete result so fields outside the resource's ownership are preserved.
* **Safe module destroy behavior:** App modules with a safe writable status are disabled before Terraform removes them from state; modules without a safe disable operation are left unchanged with a warning. All 31 template-module resources use guarded disable-on-destroy and verify the resulting remote configuration. The caching and compression resource also disables its API-coupled cache and compression status fields.
* **Typed validation and collection ownership:** Module schemas enforce reviewed API types, ranges, enums, cross-field rules, and ordered collection behavior. Omitted collections preserve remote values, explicit empty collections clear them, and configured collections replace them in Terraform order.
* **Provider connectivity controls:** Added configurable request timeout, custom CA certificate support, and an explicit insecure-TLS opt-in for development environments while retaining API-token and username/password authentication options.

## 1.0.5 (October 14, 2025)

BUG FIXES:
* resource/fortiappseccloud_waf_app: Fixed panic when head_availability and head_status_code have no default values by implementing getFloat64OrDefault helper function.

## 1.0.4 (October 3, 2025)

BUG FIXES:
* resource/fortiappseccloud_waf_app: Prevent panic (`interface{} is nil, not []interface{}`) when IPRegion API response no longer includes `region` and instead returns `support_platform_regions`.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* resource/fortiappseccloud_waf_app: Extract platform from current API field `cluster:platform` instead of deprecated `region`.

## 1.0.3 (December 9, 2024)

BUG FIXES:

* **Guides:** Fix migration document path from Guides to guides.

## 1.0.2 (December 8, 2024)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* **Guides:** Added document for FortiWebCloud migration.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* **openapi_validation:** Added document in `waf_openapi_validation.html.markdown`
